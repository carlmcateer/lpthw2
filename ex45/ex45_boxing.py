# It is a turn baed game where you have a fixed amount of stamina
# When stamina drops to zero it is the other players turn
#
# Both players have a life bar, when you life is 0 the game is over.

# You have 3 offencive moves ranging from low damage, low stamina, reliable (jab)
# to high damage, high stamina, unreliable (haymaker)
#
# Optional fetures:
#
# If you end your turn with stamina left over you have a chance to dodge attacks.
#
# In the opening menue you have the option to select more dificult chalanges(more live and stamina for enemy).
#
# You can use cheat codes to win the game.
#
# Cross and Haymaker must be "set up"
